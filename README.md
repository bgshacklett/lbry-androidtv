I started this project to develop a LBRY video browser for Android TV, it is still in developing, 
what I have done is loading trending videos, suggested channels, and allowing the user to 
sign-in with their LBRY account to load the subscriptions, wallet and searching will be added soon.

The first working version will probably be released in the next month, any feedback or PR are
welcome, and if you like this project, you can also show your support by tipping me some LBC or 
Dogecoin.
